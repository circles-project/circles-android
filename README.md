# FUTO Circles
[Circles](https://circu.li/circles.html) is an end-to-end encrypted social network app 
that enables friends and families to securely share stories and photos while safeguarding
security and privacy.

Mobile apps for [Android](https://gitlab.futo.org/circles/circles-android) and [iOS](https://gitlab.futo.org/circles/circles-ios) are under active development.

Circles is built on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), and as such, it inherits many nice
properties from Matrix, including:
* Federation - Anyone can run their own server, and users on different servers can communicate with each other seamlessly.
* Open APIs and data formats - Circles uses standard Matrix message types, and it works
  with any spec-compliant Matrix server.
* Security - Circles offers the same security guarantees as Matrix, using the same
  E2E encryption code as in Element and other popular Matrix clients.
