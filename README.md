Circles is built on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), and as such, it inherits many nice
properties from Matrix, including:
* Federation - Anyone can run their own server, and users on different servers can communicate with each other seamlessly.
* Open APIs and data formats - Circles uses standard Matrix message types, and it works
  with any spec-compliant Matrix server.
* Security - Circles offers the same security guarantees as Matrix, using the same
  E2E encryption code as in Element and other popular Matrix clients.
